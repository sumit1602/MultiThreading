//  A program consists of n thread printing 1 to 10. Below is the sample output of executing 4 concurrent threads.
//Thread 1: 1
//Thread 1: 5
//Thread 1: 9
//Thread 3: 3
//Thread 3: 7
//Thread 2: 2
//Thread 4: 4
//Thread 2: 6
//Thread 4: 8
//Thread 2: 10
//Identify the pattern and create a program to get the output for N concurrent threads.
